# Future Mobile Ownership Backlog

This document tracks parts of the iOS/mobile stack that we **could potentially own later**, but are **not planning to own in v1**.

These are all areas where Apple does not fundamentally prevent us from taking control, but where the implementation cost, risk, or complexity is too high for the initial simulator-first architecture.

## Current direction

For now, we want to focus on:

- shared mobile core
- shared rendering architecture
- simulator-first automation and logging
- minimal platform shell dependencies

This file is the backlog of areas we may revisit after the base architecture is working.

---

## 1. Text input and editing

### 1.1 Full custom text editor internals
Could own later:
- cursor movement
- selection
- copy/paste handling
- composition behavior
- autocomplete UI
- rich prompt editing

Why not now:
- very hard
- IME and international input are painful
- many edge cases

### 1.2 Full custom keyboard interaction model
Could own later:
- keyboard avoidance behavior
- custom accessory bar behavior
- advanced editor shortcuts
- custom command palette tied to keyboard state

Why not now:
- too tied to platform quirks
- easier to bridge first

---

## 2. Scrolling and gestures

### 2.1 Fully custom scroll physics
Could own later:
- inertial scroll
- rubber banding
- transcript anchoring
- nested scroll coordination
- custom scrollbars

Why not now:
- lots of tuning
- not needed to prove architecture first

### 2.2 Full gesture recognition stack
Could own later:
- gesture arbitration
- drag routing
- swipe gestures
- custom edge gestures
- multi-touch interaction model

Why not now:
- easy to overbuild
- native or host-side bridging is enough early on

---

## 3. Rendering and layout

### 3.1 Complete text shaping and layout engine
Could own later:
- line breaking
- glyph shaping
- truncation
- syntax-aware layout
- markdown and code layout

Why not now:
- huge rabbit hole
- especially tricky cross-platform

### 3.2 Full animation engine
Could own later:
- spring system
- interruptible animations
- timeline-based choreography
- transition graph
- animation debugging tools

Why not now:
- basic animation support is enough first

### 3.3 Full custom compositor and effects stack
Could own later:
- blur pipelines
- layered compositing
- shadow system
- masking and clipping effects
- advanced transitions

Why not now:
- nice-to-have, not core first milestone

### 3.4 Full custom layout engine
Could own later:
- flex or grid equivalent
- intrinsic size resolution
- constraint-like behavior
- virtualized layout
- layout invalidation engine

Why not now:
- likely worth growing into incrementally, not all at once

---

## 4. Navigation and app shell

### 4.1 Complete custom in-app navigation system
Could own later:
- stack navigation
- modals and sheets
- tab system
- deep-link routing
- screen transition manager

Why not now:
- simpler shell and navigation bridge is safer initially

### 4.2 Complete custom modal and popup framework
Could own later:
- alerts
- menus
- action sheets
- overlays
- inspector panels

Why not now:
- native or simple host-driven versions are fine first

---

## 5. Accessibility

### 5.1 Rich accessibility mapping layer
Could own later:
- semantic-to-accessibility bridge
- focus order control
- live region support
- custom actions
- accessibility tree diffing

Why not now:
- important, but should not block initial simulator work
- bridging basics first is safer

### 5.2 Full accessibility-first custom renderer support
Could own later:
- VoiceOver mapping for custom-rendered surfaces
- semantic focus synchronization
- custom accessibility hit testing

Why not now:
- real work
- should be phased after rendering foundation exists

---

## 6. Media and device integrations

### 6.1 Custom camera capture UI and pipeline
Could own later:
- camera preview
- capture UI
- crop tools
- overlays
- multi-step media workflow

Why not now:
- default or native-backed flows are enough early on

Why not now:
- not core to first simulator architecture

### 6.3 Custom photo and file picking experience
Could own later:
- custom picker shell
- media gallery UX
- attachment staging area

Why not now:
- not needed to validate the main chat and simulator loop

---

## 7. Input systems

### 7.1 Full custom focus system
Could own later:
- focus graph
- keyboard focus traversal
- responder ownership
- focus memory between screens

Why not now:
- can start with a simpler interaction model

### 7.2 Full custom hit-testing and input routing stack
Could own later:
- overlapping layers
- event capture and bubble model
- custom pointer and touch dispatch

Why not now:
- needed eventually for deep custom rendering
- too early now

---

## 8. Data and tooling

### 8.1 Full offline sync engine
Could own later:
- queued actions
- reconnect reconciliation
- optimistic UI
- conflict handling
- sync journal

Why not now:
- not needed for first simulator milestone

### 8.2 Full persistent app event journal
Could own later:
- durable action log
- replayable session state
- crash recovery from log
- cross-run state inspection

Why not now:
- we should log heavily, but full persistence and journaling can come later

### 8.3 Full fixture and replay scenario engine
Could own later:
- scenario authoring DSL
- deterministic playback
- fuzzing
- golden-state comparisons
- visual regression bundles

Why not now:
- we should design for it now, but full system can come after core exists

### 8.4 Full render and layout debug inspector
Could own later:
- live node explorer
- bounds overlays
- layout invalidation traces
- paint profiler
- interaction inspector

Why not now:
- valuable, but second-order tooling after the base simulator exists

---

## 9. Platform shell replacements

### 9.1 Replace more of the native shell
Could own later:
- more navigation chrome
- more window chrome
- more overlays
- more input UI surfaces
- more system-adjacent presentation

Why not now:
- we still want a thin host for sanity

### 9.2 More of the composer and input visuals
Could own later:
- fully custom composer
- richer prompt formatting UI
- inline token and status indicators
- custom editor overlays

Why not now:
- good future target, but we should not fight text input too early

---

## 10. Advanced visual and product surfaces

### 10.1 Advanced diff and code viewer engine
Could own later:
- syntax-aware layout
- inline comments
- folding
- side-by-side modes
- semantic diffs

Why not now:
- basic version first

### 10.2 Advanced transcript virtualization and rendering
Could own later:
- huge transcript virtualization
- partial rerender strategies
- render caching
- streaming-specific layout optimizations

Why not now:
- premature before baseline renderer exists

### 10.3 Advanced ambient dashboard visual systems
Could own later:
- charts
- timelines
- memory graphs
- live agent topology visualization
- swarm inspector UI

Why not now:
- not core to v1 simulator

- full keyboard or IME behavior
- full scroll physics
- full gesture and input routing stack

### Things we are likely to own sooner than others later
1. custom transcript rendering
2. tool cards
3. diff and code viewer

7. better transcript scrolling
8. richer composer visuals

## Rule of thumb

### Own now or soon
- core state, reducer, and logging
- semantic tree
- main rendering architecture
- simulator automation and control

### Own later
- expensive OS-adjacent behavior
- high-complexity input systems
- polished advanced rendering infrastructure
